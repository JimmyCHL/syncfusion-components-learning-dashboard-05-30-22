Above Url is the reference url to show you how to use syncfusion into your app.
Syncfusion is good because it has fully functional component for developers to utilize and implement to their app with easy way.
It is not only good for frontend and you can also connect to your backend with database as well.

In the future, when i need to use syncfusion, i would review from this github and Syncfusion's official website
